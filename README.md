Starling Framework with deferred rendering support
==================================================

This fork of Starling is modified to support multiple render targets and has a deferred renderer extension added. Requires Flash Player/AIR 14+.

Deferred renderer currently supports:

* Deferred point lights.
* Dynamic 2D shadows.

TODOs:

* Optimize rendering - some passes can be removed.
* Spotlights.
