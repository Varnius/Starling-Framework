Starling Framework with deferred rendering support
==================================================

This fork of Starling is modified to support multiple render targets and has a deferred renderer extension added.

Deferred renderer currently supports:

* Deferred point lights (done, but may need improvements)

TODOs:

* Ambient and cone lights.
* Dynamic 2D shadows.

Example project can be found [here](https://github.com/Varnius/StarlingDynamicShadows2D)
